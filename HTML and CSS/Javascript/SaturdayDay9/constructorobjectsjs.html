<!--
  Object Types (Blueprints) (Classes)
The examples from the previous chapters are limited. They only create single objects.

Sometimes we need a "blueprint" for creating many objects of the same "type".

The way to create an "object type", is to use an object constructor function.

In the example above, function Person() is an object constructor function.

Objects of the same type are created by calling the constructor function with the new keyword:

<h2>JavaScript Object Constructors</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>
<p id="demo1"></p>
<script>

// Constructor function for Person objects
function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;

}

// Create a Person object
var myFather = new Person("Rajanna", "R", 50);

var myMother = new Person("Umadevi","R",45);

// Display age
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"My father  age is " + myFather.age + ".";

document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "My Mother age  is " + myMother.age + ".";

</script>
